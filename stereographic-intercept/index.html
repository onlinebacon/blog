			<h1>Simple Celestial Navigation Method Without Estimated Position</h1>
			<hr>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>When doing a celestial navigation fix we get a circle of equal altitude for each celestial body we sight. Getting our position boils down to solving for where those circles intersect. Most common methods to find that intersection require some hard work with sight reduction tables or a calculator, plus you also need to have an estimated position of where you are.</p>
			<p>However all that is only needed because within these methods we're trying to work with a small section of Earth's surface that contains your actual position somewhere in it. If we could draw the full circles of equal altitude on a map to find their intersection then it would dismiss pretty much all the heavy math and the need for an estimated position.</p>
			<p>There are a couple of problems with that, the main one being that a flat map of Earth gets more distorted the larger the area it represents. Circles of equal altitude are most often thousands of miles wide, so they will always get very much distorted when fully drawn on a flat map. An easy solution is to simply use an actual sphere.</p>
			<p>But there's another solution that still only relies on paper and drawing tools.</p>
			<p>The image below shows two circles of equal altitude projected on an equirectangular protection of Earth as black lines. As you can see they're not really circles in this projection.</p>
			<div class="media-wrapper">
				<img src="equirectangular.png">
			</div>
			<p>Even though flat maps of the Earth will always be distorted one way or another, there is actually a workaround. One of the projections, the Stereographic projection, has the curious property that projected circles are still circles.</p>
			<p>In the image below we have the same two circles but now on a stereographic projection.</p>
			<div class="media-wrapper">
				<img src="stereographic.png">
			</div>
			<p>Even though they are circular, two distortions can be noticed. Both circles have the same radius of 45°, but when projected they end up with different sizes. Also, the black dots that marks the geographical position of the celestial bodies sighted are not where the circles are centered.</p>
			<p>However even with these distortions the circles still pass over the correct coordinates within this projection. All we have to do then, is to figure out how to draw the projected circles and finally read the coordinates of their intersection.</p>
			<h2>Plotting Longitudes</h2>
			<p>The stereographic projection is one of the azimuthal projections, which means that the azimuths from the center point are preserved. By centering the projection in one of the poles the lines of longitude become all straight, coming out of the center radially. Placing the center of a protractor in the center of the projection will give you correct angles to establish any line of longitude.</p>
			<h2>Plotting Latitudes</h2>
			<p>Latitudes will be a little trickier. In this projection latitudes get more stretched away from the center the further they are from it. But a simple solution is to print some adjustment scales for reference.</p>
			<p>In the image below there's an example of latitude scales that can be printed and used to make the plot. The mark of 90° represents the centered pole, the following angles represent how far each latitude is from the pole.</p>

			</div>
			<h2>Plotting Circles of Equal Altitude</h2>
			<p>The center of the circles are only displaced northwards or southwards from the GP of the celestial body sighted, so the centers will still be in the same line of longitude as the GPs. The easiest way to figure out where the center ends up being, is to simply find the most northern point of the circle as well as the most southern point then marking the center in the middle of those two points. By doing that we also get the projected radius, because that's just half the distance between the two points of the circle we established.</p>
			<h2>Doing an Intercept</h2>
			<p>Let's see how an intercept of this method actually looks like. For simplicity we'll work with two star sights and no transit (no motion in between readings). Let's sat after working out the geographical position and zenith distances we got the following data:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Pollux: GP = <span>27°58.3'N</span>, <span>°6.3'E</span>; Zenith = <span>37°36.6'</span></li>
				<li>Capella: GP = <span>46°1.2'N</span>, <span>37°29.1'W</span>; Zenith = <span>39°7.4'</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's find the most northern and most southern ends of each of the circles first. Given that each zenith distance represents the radius of the circle, adding the zenith distance to the latitude of the GP gives us the latitude of the most northern point, while subtracting the zenith distance from the latitude of the GP gives us the latitude of the most southern point.</p>
